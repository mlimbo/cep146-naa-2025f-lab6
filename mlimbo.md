Q: What is the difference between a git "merge" and a GitHub "pull request"
A: The main difference between a git "merge" and a GitHub "pull request" is that a git merge forces the changes which can be dangerous if you have multiple changes and differences in a file. A git "merge" also deletes the branch automatically whereas a "pull request" is a manual option to delete a branch (GitHub has an option where "pull request" can delete the branch automatically). A "pull request" is how it is worded; it is a request to commit the changes to the branch that is called. The owner of the branch may accept or decline the pull request.
